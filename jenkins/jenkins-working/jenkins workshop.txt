This should be enough to get started with Vagrant. If not, pick up from the preceding line in Ansible Workshop.

Start Vagrant machine
	$vagrant up
	$vagrant global-status
		to get id/name of machine
	$vagrant ssh <machine_name_or_id>

Install Jenkins (from virtual machine)
	$wget -q -O - https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io.key | sudo apt-key add -
	$sudo vim /etc/apt/sources.list
#/etc/apt/sources.list
#add the following line to the end
deb https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/
	$sudo apt update
	$sudo apt install default-jdk
	$java -version
	$sudo apt-get update
	$sudo apt-get install jenkins

Start Jenkins
	$sudo systemctl start jenkins
	check status with $sudo systemctl status jenkins

Visit Jenkins in browser
	in vagrant machine, get ip address with $ifconfig
	in host machine, visit ipaddress:8080
		(vagrant is headless, but can run with gui)
		(also, verify port, especially if firewall exception is necessary)
		https://www.jenkins.io/doc/pipeline/tour/getting-started/
	password for Jenkins is in vagrant machine $sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
	it may be in a different folder, follow instructions that browser page offers for signing in.


New Job
	New Item > New Pipeline
		Jenkins > New Item > enter name, choose Pipeline > ok
		input script text
	Run Build
		choose build now
		reload page if you can add params

Integrate with GitHub (no creds required)
	New Item > New Pipeline
		Jenkins > New Item > enter name, choose Pipeline > ok
		Change Definition (under Pipeline) to Pipeline script from SCM
		Change SCM to Git, add repository URL (with .git at the end)
		Under Build Triggers, check Poll SCM, add schedule
		Save the pipeline
	Make sure repository has Jenkinsfile
#Jenkinsfile
pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                echo 'Building..'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                echo 'Testing..'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                echo 'Deploying....'
            }
        }
    }
}



Integrate with GitHub (with creds)
	Get API key from Github
		Github > User settings > Developer settings
		Personal access tokens > Generate New
		jenkins-integration as name/note (or similar format) > check repo, admin:repo_hook, and notifications
		Copy the token value and bring it to Jenkins *save this for following webhook setup*
	Connect to Github
		Jenkins > Manage Jenkins > Configure System
		Scroll down to Github > Add Github Server > change name to github
		Under Credentials, choose add > change Kind to Secret text > paste Github token in  Secret field > make ID same as note/name supplied in Github for token > choose Add
		Click - none -, choose jenkins-integration
		Click Test Connection. Success == "Credentials verified..."

Trigger Github Webhook build
	New Item > enter name, choose New Multibranch Pipeline > ok
	Branch Sources > Add Source > Github > Credentials > Add > Jenkins
	Enter Github username, token (as password), unique id
	Enter repository URL, click Validate, make sure Build Configuration Mode is by jenkinsfile Save
	#Click Scan Repository Now
	******Note: webhook should trigger automatically. But must expose any local environments so that Github knows where to send POST.
		$sudo apt-get update
		$sudo apt-get install ngrok-client
		$ngrok web01:80


Add SSH build agent
	Manage Jenkins > Manage Nodes > New Node
		name > ok
		2 executors, remote root directory: /home/jenkins, labels: metal, Launch method: via ssh
		Global domain, SSH Username with private key, Global scope, enter jenkins-ssh or something unique as ID, jenkins as username
		Host Key: Non verifying

Scale builds with a cloud service
	Manage Jenkins > Manage Plugins > Google Compute

Using Docker Images for Agents
...

Notifications
	Manage Jenkins > Manage Plugins > Slack
	or add browser extension (e.g. Jenkins Notifier for Chrome)

Job View Status Badge
	Manage Jenkins > Manage Plugins > embeddable build status

Code coverage tests and reports
	New Item > name, pipeline, ok
	Add code formatted to test and create artifact(s).
		NOTE it is possible to add manual trigger to indicate test should continue
	Coverage Plugins can also help
#pipeline code
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh '''
                  echo This > app.sh
                  echo That >> app.sh
                '''
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh '''
                  grep This app.sh >> ${BUILD_ID}.cov
                  grep That app.sh >> ${BUILD_ID}.cov
                '''
            }
        }
        stage('Coverage'){
            steps {
                sh '''
                  app_lines=`cat app.sh | wc -l`
                  cov_lines=`cat ${BUILD_ID}.cov | wc -l`
                  echo The app has `expr $app_lines - $cov_lines` lines uncovered > ${BUILD_ID}.rpt
                  cat ${BUILD_ID}.rpt
                '''
                archiveArtifacts "${env.BUILD_ID}.rpt"
            }
        }
    }
}



Test Results Stop a build
	Pipeline script must include conditions for exiting during job

REST API POST to trigger build
	get user token
		Jenkins UI > user icon in upper-right corner > configure > API token: add new token, name it
			110bdddbc2ba88c8f31ff5525e1ae81bca
	request csrf crumb, copy output up until $
		$curl --user "admin:TOKEN" 'http://jenkins.kumulus.co:8080/crumbIssuer/api/xml?xpath=concat(//crumbRequestField,":",//crumb)'
	save crumb
	$curl -X POST http://jenkins.kumulus.co:8080/job/multi-step/build --user admin:TOKEN --data-urlencode json='' -H "Jenkins-Crumb:....."
		note that local vms require special setup to expose them to the internet and be able to receive post requests

Security
	Manage Jenkins > Configure Global Security
		change authorization strategy to Matrix-Based Security
		create admin user group, give all access
		provision everything else more selectively
	Credentials stores values that can be secret. These won't necessarily be exposed in the pipeline.
	Audit
		See builds at Jenkins > (arrow next to Jenkins) > All > Build History
		Manage Jenkins > Manage Plugins > look for Audit Trail
			Add it, restart Jenkins
			Jenkins > Manage Jenkins > Configure System > scroll to Audit Trail
			Add Logger > Log file > add path
	Folders for Security
		Jenkins > New Item > name, choose Folder > ok

Creating distinguishable artifacts (files)
	Include line in pipeline
		archiveArtifacts artifacts: 'filename.txt', fingerprint: true, onlyIfSuccessful: true
#pipeline script text
...
				stage('Archive') {
            steps {
                archiveArtifacts artifacts: 'output.txt', fingerprint: true, onlyIfSuccessful: true
            }
        }
...
	Jenkins > Check File Fingerprint

Job promotion for long-running pipelines
	...

Snippets
	Pipeline code chooser that supplies lines of code that fulfill a certain functionality
	Choose pipeline syntax link under pipeline script box.

Global Variables
	couldn't find link

Best practices
	distribute builds with agents
	automate/install agents
	Library(@UserLib)
	Jenkinsfile (on github) as code
	Use views to organize
