Swarm

TLDR:
Container orchestration
Nodes
	the host
	controlled by swarm
containers
	runs on one host/node
	shares network and storage w/ other containers
	hard to scale and keep available
tasks
services
	runs across all targeted nodes
	highly available, scalable




docker stack has:
	web service
	db service
	report service
	stack file:
		defines app to swarm cluster
		YAML
	$docker stack deploy ...
	$docker stack services

Replicated service vs global service
	limited assignment v. completely filling a cluster

Can create service from template
