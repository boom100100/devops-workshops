TLDR:
use to get to market fast	
Google Compute Engine
	virtual machines
	app engine, compute engine, kubernetes engine, cloud functions, cloud run
Google Kubernetes Engine
	raw container clusters
Google App Engine, Google Cloud Functions
	managed container clusters
Google Cloud Functions
	functions
Google Cloud Storage
	storage buckets - files
Google Cloud SQL
	store data

scaleable

account objects
organization => folders => teams => projects => infrastructure

projects
	consists of id, name, number

resources
	

compute engine api

vm setup
	hw requirements (CPU, RAM)

GCE resources
	can put them in a Kubernetes (or docker?) cluster
	Cloud Run for bring-your-own-container


istio
knative

Cloud Run/Cloud Run on GKE architectures
	knative (api)
	gcloud (cli)



Google Cloud Functions (competitor to AWS Lambda)

Google BigTable
	stores data in massively scalable tables


memorystore
	managed database service


datastore
	nosql-managed wide column stores

Google pub/sub (publish and subscribe)
	many-to-many messaging

Google Dataprep trifacta
	builds data pipelines
	integrates with GCS and BigQuery

Google Data Fusion
	builds data pipelines
	integrates with many more than what Google Dataprep can connect to

Google Data Studio
	takes bigquery result and presents it visually in way of user's choice
	creates reports
	supports many data sources

GCP Machine Learning
	ML Engine/AI Platform
		AI Hub
			indexes machine learning services
		managed Jupyter notebooks
			can import bigQuery
			can run as alt cli
		model training
		prediction
		kubeflow


Cloud Vision API
	runs jobs and models
	AutoML Image Classification can recognize things in a photo

Cloud AutoML Tables
	bigQuery or cloud storage
		data from GCS bucket in the same region
		data also must be from regional, not multi-regional bucket
		data must have 1000 rows
	train model based on data features - hyperparameterization
		E.g. To predict price, the service will examine the data based on what it determines is the best model. Then, it will return what correlations exist between specific features and price. For example, in one model, the product for sale often  was related to what price appeared in that data row. Adding new incomplete data can then fill in an unspecified price.

Cloud Scheduler and Tasks
	Cloud Scheduler and Tasks do scheduled or one-off tasks

Pub/Sub v. Cloud Tasks
	?

aerospike
	option for no-sql third-party vendor database

Cloud Code
	integrates w/ IDE

Stackdriver 
	Logs, monitoring

gcp application architecture concepts
	microservices
		functions or serverless
		can bring your own container
	containers
		kubernetes
			libraries knative kubeflow
			abstraction level
	virtual machines
		control and management

single-page and API-based architectures
	static
	content hosting
	api hosting

web blog and managed databases
	dynamic hosting
	look in marketplace for common architectures

web app on Google App Engine
	storage, database, functions, and Cloud Vision API
	Cloud Vision API
		can easily and quickly add complex machine learning functionality to app 
	

Big data log processing
	can be serverless
