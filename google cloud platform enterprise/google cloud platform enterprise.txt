Google Cloud Platform Enterprise

TLDR:
enterprise concerns:
	availability, reliability
	cost, security, compliance
	services and partners
GCP structure
	organization => folders => projects => resources

Core enterprise scenarios
	lift and shift
	new internal application



Core enterprise scenarios
	lift and shift
		migrating to GCP service
		start w/ migrating virtual machines
		use Anthos Migrate and Config Management
	new internal application
		choose serverless or containers*
			*note: serverless can have containers, too
			can limit customer to serverless host because they aren't (easily) migrate-able
		
	
cloud scenarios
	ci/cd pipeline
	drift detection

access control
	G Suite domains
	manage active directory

project inherits permissions from organization

config for use options
	GCLOUD
		scripting
	GCP SDK
		select language and ide
	third-party options

virtual private cloud (VPC) network
	associate subnets
	can share
	choose between regional or global dynamic routing

cloud adoption patterns
	move internal to cloud
	create new app

Cloud Spanner
	for exporting database to Cloud Storage bucket
	or use Cloud Dataflow Connector to read/write data to Cloud Spanner in a Cloud Dataflow pipeline

IoT Core
	devices, gateways, monitoring

Event Data pipelines tools
	Google Dataproc
		managed hadoop spark clusters (Apache Spark, can have Jupyter notebooks)
	Google Dataflow
		data processing (Apache Beam)
	Cloud Composer
	BigQuery


Apache Beam
	higher-level abstraction
	you can connect Apache Spark to it
	
	alternative to Dataproc and Dataflow

Genomics data pipelines
	variant transforms tool

ci/cd
	ci: code, build, test
	cont. dev: code, build, test, artifact management
	cont. deployment: code, build, test, artifact management, deploy

ci/cd artifacts
virtual machines, containers, serverless, mobile

Deployments, GCP Marketplace, and templates
	marketplace has known-good configurations
	when deploying a brand-new project, start with one environment, and expand if desired and necessary after getting the first one working

Private Catalog and Container Registry

cloud source repositories
	source code

cloud build
